Help get the Danidev on r/place 2022

Use a Chromium based browser (Google Chrome, Edge, Opera, Yandex.Browser) Firefox not working!

Android folks can use Kiwi Browser + Tampermonkey.

Install "Tampermonkey" extension (https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

Open the following page in your browser:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KyoMiyake/Danidev-Bot/blob/main/minimap.user.js

This will open Tampermonkey and invite you to install the userscript.

Click on the canvas to get it to load.
